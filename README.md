## Algorithm Details

The desmoking/de-hazing algorithm is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on datasets containing smoky and clear images. The training process involves:

- **Data Collection:** Assembling a diverse dataset of images and videos with varying smoke and haze levels.
- **Preprocessing:** Normalizing and augmenting the dataset to enhance model robustness.
- **Training:** Using supervised learning to minimize the discrepancy between predicted clear images and ground truth.
- **Evaluation:** Testing the model on unseen data to ensure performance and generalization.
